#### About Me

> Hey there! I’m John Rey Rosales, your friendly neighborhood designer. I spend my days diving into the world of design—whether it’s sketching on paper or clicking away on my computer, I’m always on the lookout for new tools to level up my creative game.

> When I’m not busy crafting visuals, you can find me exploring new places and soaking up different cultures. I also have a soft spot for badminton; it’s my go-to way to stay active and have a little fun. Life’s all about balance, right? I’m excited to share my adventures and designs with you!
